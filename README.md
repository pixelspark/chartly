# Chartly.js: build charts in the browser using d3.js and Blockly.

Chartly.js is a web component that allows end users to create ('program') a chart using the Blockly
visual programming environment. Charts are 'compiled' to a JSON specification for the chart. At run
time, Chartly interprets the JSON and draws the chart using d3.js.

## How to use

Store the contents in a web-accessible folder and open chartly.html to try out the example editor. 
The example editor will also work when run directly from your hard drive (file://), only loading of
examples will fail. The example editor automatically generates fake numeric data of variable sizes
for testing purposes.

Using Chartly.js in your web application should be relatively straightforward; see the example editor
in chartly.html. Note that you can persist chart designs in JSON as well as XML, but only XML can be
read back to puzzle pieces (the JSON is meant for run-time rendering of a chart).

## JSON chart specification

The JSON used to specify instructions for rendering a chart follow a simple structure.  A 'command' 
is written as an array with two elements: the command identifier and its parameters (if any). Commands
can (and usually are) nested. An example of JSON produced by Chartly.js is the following:

````javascript
["align", {
	"vertical":"middle",
	"horizontal":"middle",
	"child": ["text", {
		"text": ["string", "Hello world"],
		"child":null,
		"next":null
	}],
	"next":null
}]
````
The example JSON above renders the text 'Hello world' in the center of the canvas. The root command
is `align` (with parameters vertical=middle and horizontal=middle). The `align` command takes a sub-
command for the `child` parameter, which is in this case is the `text` command. The `text` command 
takes a sub-command that specifies the actual text to render (in this case a string). Sibling items
can be inserted using the `next` parameter and child items using the `child` item, but this is not
the case in the example.
